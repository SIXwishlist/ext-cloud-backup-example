Each Plesk user (Admin/Reseller/Customer) can use his own local folder to back up his domains to it.

Features:

- Backup domains to a local folder
- Backup on demand, initiated by a user
- Scheduled backups with rotation policy for old backups
- Restoration of domains and particular files from a backup stored to a local folder
